## Overview
This project implements two models:
1. **Image Classification** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**.
2. **Speech Recognition** using **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** or **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks.

Both models are trained to perform tasks like:
- Image classification from datasets like **MNIST** (handwritten digits) or **CIFAR-10** (common objects).
- Speech-to-text recognition for spoken commands or phrases.

# Project: Image Classification & Speech Recognition with CNNs and RNNs

## Overview
This project implements two models:
1. **Image Classification** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**.
2. **Speech Recognition** using **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** or **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks.

Both models are trained to perform tasks like:
- Image classification from datasets like **MNIST** (handwritten digits) or **CIFAR-10** (common objects).
- Speech-to-text recognition for spoken commands or phrases.

## Training the Model

```python
# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=64, validation_split=0.1)
```

**Parameters:**
- `X_train` and `y_train`: Training features and labels.
- `epochs=10`: Train the model for 10 passes over the dataset.
- `batch_size=64`: Divide the data into batches of 64 samples for weight updates.
- `validation_split=0.1`: Use 10% of the training data for validation.

**Sample Results:**
| Epoch | Training Accuracy | Training Loss | Validation Accuracy | Validation Loss |
|-------|--------------------|---------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| 1     | 86.66%             | 0.4445        | 98.25%              | 0.0580          |
| 2     | 98.17%             | 0.0578        | 98.40%              | 0.0544          |
| ...   | ...                | ...           | ...                 | ...             |
| 10    | 99.67%             | 0.0092        | 99.02%              | 0.0405          |

**Insights:**
- **Accuracy and Loss Trends:**
  - Training and validation accuracy both increase over epochs.
  - Loss decreases, showing that the model is learning effectively.

- **Overfitting:**
  - To avoid overfitting, Early Stopping and Learning Rate Scheduling were implemented.

## Early Stopping and Learning Rate Scheduling

```python
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping, ReduceLROnPlateau

# Early Stopping
early_stop = EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', patience=3, restore_best_weights=True)

# Learning Rate Scheduler
reduce_lr = ReduceLROnPlateau(monitor='val_loss', factor=0.2, patience=2, min_lr=0.0001)
```

- **Early Stopping:** Halts training when validation loss stops improving.
- **Learning Rate Scheduling:** Dynamically reduces the learning rate when validation loss plateaus.

**Updated Model Training:**

```python
history = model.fit(
    X_train, y_train,
    epochs=50,
    batch_size=64,
    validation_split=0.1,
    callbacks=[early_stop, reduce_lr]
)
```

## Regularization Techniques

**Dropout and Batch Normalization:**
- Dropout layers are added to prevent overfitting, with different rates applied:
  - 25% Dropout after convolutional layers.
  - 50% Dropout before the dense layers.

## Hyperparameter Tuning

- Hyperparameters were optimized using Keras Tuner, which tested configurations to find the best setup.
- **Optimal Hyperparameters:**
  - Conv2D layer filters: 128 (first), 192 (second).
  - Dense layer units: 256.
  - Optimizer: Adam.

## Implementing Residual Networks (ResNet)

- ResNet uses skip connections to solve the vanishing gradient problem in deep neural networks.

**Model Summary:**
- Residual blocks with convolutional layers.
- Skip connections ensure information passes through even in deeper networks.

## Installation and Setup

**Clone the repository:**
